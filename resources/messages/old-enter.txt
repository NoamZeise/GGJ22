Huh, it looks like no one has been in the old laboratory for a very long time, but still… I found that list outside here, could it be… the items that were needed to stop the reactor destabilising and turning the earth into an uninhabitable wasteland?
I just need to find a piece of PVC pipe, a glass bottle, some eco-friendly bin bags and a radio. A bit strange but who am I to judge? I reckon everything I need is conveniently placed within the lab that the old reactor is also in, so I shall venture forth!
